Welcome to Zwitter
=======================

NOTE:
--------
The following Application has nothing to do with HeRMAPHRODITE or German Band RAMMSTEIN, as some of you would link to by reading the name.
The name is just a fusion of my nick Zarthon + Twitter = Zwitter.  :P

Introduction
=============

Special Thanks to DeWitt Clinton for developing such a wonderfull library for Twitter in python

Zwitter is just a simple GUI frontend for twitter API created using tools:
    Python
    QtDesigner
    PyQt4
    pyuic4
    Twitter library for python (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter)
    
Zwitter is basically result of me wanting to learn PyQt4 bindings and my liking towards Twitter.

Zwitter has  all the major functionalities of a standard Twitter API such as:
    
    Display Latest Messages on Twitter
    Latest Messages of Friends
    Add Friend, Destroy Friendship
    Post Status, Delete Status, Retweet etc.
    Get Replies, Post Replies
    Get Direct Messages and Send Direct Messages

Limitations
===========

Zwitter has some limitations though:
    
    In post New Message only one line is displayed.
    When Status is too small then in main Widget it s shown after User ScreenName
    As profile images are downloaded, profile_images folder becomes heavy and can occupy significant amount of space
    Sometimes Even though an eror is shown, but the function gets completed succesfully
    It Takes some time for the app to show main dialog as it loads the data of the Twitter user specified by the EndUser
    You have to enter Username and Password Everytime you restart the application
